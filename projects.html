            <h3>Medical Store Management System</h3>
            <p>
              The Medical Store Management System is a web-based application
              designed to streamline and automate the management of a medical
              store's operations. Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and
              Mongoose, this system provides intuitive CRUD (Create, Read,
              Update, Delete) functionalities for core entities, including
              Customer, Medicine, Pharmacist, and Inventory. Users can add,
              update, or delete medicines with details like Medicine Name,
              Medicine ID, Price, and Quantity, ensuring accurate stock
              management. Additionally, the system enables efficient customer
              tracking and pharmacist records management, promoting operational
              efficiency and improving the overall user experience in a medical
              retail setting.

            <h3>Rock-Paper-Scissor Game</h3>
            <p>
              The console-based game developed in Python offers an engaging
              experience where users can challenge the computer in a classic
              game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. Players can select their moves, and
              the program uses randomization to determine the computer's choice,
              providing a fair and unpredictable gameplay experience. This
              project showcases fundamental programming concepts such as loops,
              conditionals, and user input handling, while also emphasizing game
              logic and interaction. The simplicity of the game, combined with
              its interactive nature, makes it an excellent introduction to game
              development in Python.
